# Microservices DevOps Project

## Overview

This project showcases a microservices-based architecture for an eCommerce application. The application is designed to be scalable and modular, with each microservice responsible for a specific functionality. The infrastructure is automated using Docker and Kubernetes, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) is implemented using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

## Microservices

- **Service A:** A microservice built with Flask that provides basic operations, such as responding with a welcome message.
- **Service B:** Another Flask-based microservice that could handle operations like user management or product catalog.
- **Service C:** A third Flask service, potentially responsible for handling orders or payments.

## Infrastructure and Automation

- **Docker:** Containerizes each microservice, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of the microservices across a cluster.
- **CI/CD:** Automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application using Jenkins or GitHub Actions, ensuring quick and reliable delivery of updates.
